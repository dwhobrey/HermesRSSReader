Areas For Improvement:

1).  Fix remaining memory leaks! Obvious ones have been plugged. Need a Javascript guru to look at this please!  
2).  Internationalization, for example, improve Right-To-Left text layout.  
3).  Use FeedsManager AsyncLoad per Feed via event handler added to FeedsWatcher: couldn't get this to work per Feed.  
4).  Page monitoring: add commands to auto navigate website forms to point of interest.  
5).  Fix auto clicking: sometimes flyout doesn't appear after hovering.  
6).  Use themes, e.g. to change palette, background color etc.  
Any volunteers for the above?
